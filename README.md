This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js applications: unhandled promise rejections causing the server to crash.  The `server.js` file contains code that simulates a long-running request and an asynchronous operation that can reject a promise.  The rejection is not handled, causing the server to terminate unexpectedly. The `serverSolution.js` file provides a solution to this problem using a process.on('unhandledRejection') event listener.  This ensures that even if promises are rejected, the application continues running gracefully.
